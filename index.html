            <h1>Full Moon</h1>
            <h2>What are we GRATEFUL for?!</h2>
            <p>Representing the mid-point of the 29 day lunar cycle, the energy of the Full Moon is powerfully backed by emotions. All feelings, thoughts, and dreams are amplified. During this time negative tension may rise, leaving you out of whack. Now is the time to harness all of the Full Moon's energy and make it positive by expressing <strong>gratitude</strong>. </p>
            <h3>Now is the time to show appreciation.</h3>
            <p>Convey gratitude for manifestations you've brought into light. Express appreciation for future manifestations as if they are in the present. </p>
            <h3>How can I express gratitude?!</h3>
             <p>Moon bathe! Sit under the moons light and meditate. Feel the moon wrap around your body as you inhale, as you exhale feel the amplify your desires. </p>

            <h1>Waning Gibbous</h1>
            <h2>Check yourself out!</h2>
            <p>Your first thought might have been to run to the mirror, but checking yourself out goes far beyond that. The Waning Gibbous is about self-examination.</p>
            <h2>Introspect</h2>
            <p>Take some time to look within and examine thoughts and feeligs. Acknowledge bad habits, becuase its time to dispel them. Now would be a good time to generate good healthy habits. Habits can be mental and physical of course.  </p>
            <h2>But I've a hard time sticking to healthy habits</h2>
            <h4>You dont have a hard time sticking to good habits. You just have not found your "why" yet. Recognize what gives you that little kick of energy and explore it. Let's say your little energy kick is from wanting to move to another country. Dive deeper into thought and hold onto it. Make all those reasons your "why" to keep up this good habit. Also keep in mind we live an instant lifestyle. Everything we pracitically need or want is in our hand instantly. When we dont see those results in an instant we tend to lose focus. Take your time, be patient and always be better than yesterday. </h4>

        <div id="lastQuartINFO">
            <h1>Last Quarter</h1>
            <h2>Let that thang GOOO!</h2>
            <p>Last quarter is all about the release! This month has introduced many great things, but it also might have shed too much light on some negatives. Now is this time to forgive, let go and move on. We want a fresh start when the New Moon arrives. </p>
            <h2>Cleanse......</h2>
            <p>Cleanse your surroundings. If it no longer serves it purpose, Get rid of it. Revaluate your relationships. Declutter you living spaces. Cleanse your body. Light up some incense and get to work! </p>
        </div>

        <div id="waningCrescentINFO">
            <h1>Waning Crescent</h1>
            <h2>Surrender</h2>
            <p>Let faith take the will. During this moon phase you should be relaxed and prepared for the New Moon. Pay attention to messages and signs. Deepen your relaxtion with a nice bath or meditation.  </p>
        </div>

        <div id="newMoonInfo">
            <h1>New Moon</h1>
            <h2>We are starting over... again!</h2>
            <p>We've made it another new beginning. During this New Moon we may retreat or regain strength. The New Moon symbolises the menses. Historically, women took time away from others during this phase. Regardless of your gender, it's a good time to be alone. Appreciate your alone time. </p>
            <h2>Ive plans!</h2>
            <p>If you just so happen to feel introverted in this moment, its okay to cancel plans. Tuning into yourself and turning off from the outside is best during the New Moon.</p>
